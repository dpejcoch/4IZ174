### 2. Content Requirements

Your video must address **both** of the following sections:

#### Section A: What Data Quality Management IS About (60% of video)

Explain in your own words what Data Quality Management encompasses. You should address:

**Required Elements:**
- Core definition of Data Quality Management
- Key dimensions or characteristics of data quality (e.g., accuracy, completeness, consistency, timeliness, etc.)
- Primary objectives and goals of DQM
- Stakeholders involved in DQM
- At least 2-3 concrete examples or scenarios that illustrate DQM in practice

- Provide real-world context or examples
- Connect DQM to organizational outcomes

#### Section B: What Data Quality Management is NOT About (40% of video)

Clarify common misconceptions and distinguish DQM from related disciplines. You should address:

**Required Elements:**
- At least 3-4 common misconceptions about DQM
- Clear distinctions between DQM and related disciplines such as:
  - Data Governance (explain the relationship and differences)
  - Data Management (execution vs. oversight)
  - Database Administration
  - Business Intelligence/Analytics
  - Data Engineering
  - Master Data Management
- Why these distinctions matter in practice

**Suggested Approach:**
- Use phrases like "DQM is not just..." or "DQM should not be confused with..."

### 3. Presentation Requirements

**Personal Appearance:**
- You must be visible in the video (face and upper body)
- Maintain eye contact with the camera

**Communication Style:**
- Speak clearly and at a moderate pace
- Use professional language (avoid slang)
- Demonstrate enthusiasm and engagement with the topic
- NO reading from notes or slides (you may use brief bullet points off-camera)
- Natural delivery is expected – you should sound conversational but professional

**Structure:**
- Brief introduction (name, program of study) – 15-30 seconds
- Section A: What DQM IS about – approximately 2-3 minutes
- Section B: What DQM is NOT about – approximately 1-2 minutes
- Brief conclusion/closing statement – 15-30 seconds

---

### 4. Authenticity and Academic Integrity

**Critical Requirement:**
- This must be **YOUR OWN UNDERSTANDING** in **YOUR OWN WORDS**
- Do NOT memorize or recite textbook definitions
- Do NOT use AI-generated scripts (violations will be considered academic misconduct)
- You may reference course materials, but your explanation must demonstrate personal synthesis
- If you quote specific definitions or frameworks, you must cite them verbally (e.g., "As Gartner defines it...")

**What "Own Words" Means:**
- You have synthesized course concepts through your personal understanding
- You can explain concepts using examples from your own experience or imagination
- You can draw connections that reflect your unique perspective
- Your language is natural and conversational, not textbook-like

---

### 5. Prohibited Practices

The following will result in **automatic failure** of the assignment:

❌ Using AI-generated scripts without personal synthesis

❌ Having another person appear in or narrate your video  
❌ Copying content verbatim from course materials or external sources  
❌ Submitting a video that does not show your face  
❌ Using copyrighted background music or content without permission

## Tips for Success

### Before Recording:

✓ **Prepare an outline** (not a script) with key points you want to cover  
✓ **Practice your delivery** 2-3 times to refine your thoughts  
✓ **Test your equipment** (camera, microphone, lighting)  
✓ **Choose a quiet location** free from background noise and interruptions  
✓ **Time yourself** during practice runs  

### During Recording:

✓ **Take a deep breath** and relax before you start  
✓ **Smile and be natural** – imagine you're explaining to a colleague  
✓ **Use examples** from your own experience or interests when possible  
✓ **If you make a mistake**, pause briefly and continue (don't restart unless necessary)  
✓ **Maintain energy** throughout the video  

### Content Development:

✓ **Think about your audience** – explain as if to someone unfamiliar with DQM  
✓ **Use concrete examples** rather than abstract concepts alone  
✓ **Draw from course discussions** that resonated with you  
✓ **Consider your own experiences** with data quality issues in work or daily life  
✓ **Ask yourself**: "If I had to explain this to a friend, how would I say it?"

## Common Pitfalls to Avoid

1. **Sounding robotic**: Don't memorize word-for-word; know your key points and speak naturally
2. **Going off-topic**: Stay focused on DQM; don't get lost in tangential discussions
3. **Being too vague**: Use specific examples to illustrate your points
4. **Ignoring the "what it's NOT" section**: This section is equally important
5. **Poor time management**: Allocate appropriate time to both sections
6. **Technical issues**: Always do a test recording first

## Frequently Asked Questions

**Q: Can I use slides or visual aids in my video?**  
A: No. This assignment focuses on your ability to communicate verbally. You should be the sole focus of the video.

**Q: Can I edit my video to cut out mistakes?**  
A: Yes, basic editing to remove mistakes or pauses is acceptable. However, the final video should flow naturally.

**Q: What if I'm uncomfortable being on camera?**  
A: This is a professional skill you'll need to develop. Practice will help. Remember, your classmates and instructor are your only audience. If you have significant concerns, please discuss with the instructor privately.

**Q: Can I use examples from our textbook or lectures?**  
A: Yes, but you must explain them in your own words and contextualize them with your understanding. Simply restating textbook examples verbatim is not sufficient.

**Q: How formal should my language be?**  
A: Professional but conversational. Imagine you're presenting at a team meeting, not delivering a formal academic paper.

**Q: What if I go 10 seconds over 5 minutes?**  
A: A few seconds over is acceptable. However, videos significantly longer than 5 minutes (more than 30 seconds over) will be penalized.
